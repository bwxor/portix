# Portix: Open-Source Port Scanning Tool

## Binaries

iport is, as of now, available for:
- Windows
- Linux

> **Note:** Binaries are currently only available as "fat" `.jar` files, which means that you need to have a running version of the [Java Runtime Environment 25](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.

The preferred OS-specific binary can be download from [here](https://github.com/bwxor/portix/releases).
